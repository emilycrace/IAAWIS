<h2> Be A Mentor </h2>

  <p> Only one in four women who graduates with a degree related to science, technology, engineering or math continues to work in that field 10 years after graduation. We need your help to change that. As a woman in a STEM-related career, we invite you to volunteer as a mentor to a UK undergraduate woman majoring or minoring in a STEM discipline. Mentors will regularly interact with one or more students (to be determined by you and your mentee) and attend gatherings with the #IAmAWomanInSTEM student leaders, the leadership teams, and visitors.</p>

<p>  At the core of the initiative is a leadership effort by young college-going women in an awareness campaign by and for undergraduates (via a shared hashtag for social media - #IAmAWomanInSTEM). Crucial to this leadership effort’s success is our mentoring program connecting undergraduate females who are in STEM majors/minors with female faculty/staff members and women in business/industry with STEM backgrounds. The #IAmAWomanInSTEM initiative should build on existing retention and student success initiatives in postsecondary institutions and directly address strategic objectives on diversity, high-impact educational practices, and civic engagement. We seek additional partners to support these efforts, both financially and in volunteer hours.</p>

            <h1>Mentor Responsibilities</h1>
            #IAmAWomanInSTEM asks for the mentor volunteers to meet with their assigned student ambassadors at times that are determined to be best for each other (aiming for a total of 20 hours contact time per calendar year). In addition, we include the mentors in a private Googlegroup where general announcements are made by the leadership team (perhaps one or two messages per month). We also encourage the mentors to participate in our social media accounts (see icons in bottom left nav bar). Student ambassadors have used their personal social media accounts, and in-person presentations, to launch their own campaigns to support women in STEM. Ideally, these projects are supported and guided by their mentors.

            <h1>Mentor Testimonial </h1>
            <p> "When Randolph Hollingsworth asked if I’d like to be a part of an effort to retain undergraduate women in STEM majors, I was happy to promote a true passion of mine -- advocating for women, and particularly for women in science. As faculty and women in STEM, the steering team wanted to set a framework for students to build their own initiative, one that empowers women in STEM, challenges stereotypes, creates connections, and raises awareness about issues for women in STEM: the pay gap, institutionalized sexism, and succeeding in male-dominated fields. Stories are powerful, and sharing stories of women in STEM — the challenges, the successes, the failures — can help women to understand that their experience is not unique. It’s a beautiful thing to see so many women empowering and supporting one another!"
              - Dr. Kate Eddens, Department of Health Behavior, UK College of Public Health </p>
