     <h2>Leadership</h2>
     <p> An important component of the initiative is for our student ambassadors to take on leadership roles. There are no formal requirements but all who signed up to be a part of the initiative are expected to come up with their own way of providing a leadership role in raising awareness on campus and beyond regarding the issues involved in persisting and succeeding as a woman in STEM fields.

There are important ways by which to examine the kinds of leadership efforts undertaken with #IAmAWomanInSTEM service projects; and, we rely on the AAC&U's Civic Engagement VALUE Rubric (download .pdf here) to evaluate whether a contribution to the initiative enriches both personally and publicly and is socially beneficial to our community. </p>
